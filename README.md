# Propitiation

(Romans 3:25) Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;

(1 John 2:2) And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.

(1 John 4:10) Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.

#### Simple 3D Javascript Particles Engine ####

Sparks.js is a library to help create 3D particles in Javascript.

I hope that it is a simple, fast and fun particles engine to play with.

This is an ongoing project, so check out issue tracker, the [wiki](https://github.com/zz85/sparks.js/wiki), the code, and the examples inside github.

Sparks.js welcome feature and pull requests, so don't be shy to fork away!

It uses [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) for Vector classes and rendering and ease functions from [tween.js](https://github.com/sole/tween.js/).
